# Billboards

This Vue.js app retrieves billboards and the latest news from the UC Santa Cruz website and formats a 16x9 page for display on kiosk screens. We add QR codes to each link so viewers can read the stories. You can see the rendered results here: <https://ucsc-billboard-screens.netlify.com>
